# Controlling QTrobot arms using MoveIt
This advanced examples demosntrate how to use ROS MoveIT to control QTrobot arms. The examples draw some shapes (i,e. rectangle and spirals) on the XY plane in robot frame.

## Preparation and requirements
Before running the example, please ensure that following setups of your QTrobot and the machine which you are running the example.

### QTrobot setup
By default QTrobot motors interface runs in *'normal'* mode. in normal mode, the motors control loop and joints state publisher run in low frequency (2-5hz). More importantly the joint position values are in *degree*. To be able to use MoveIt with QTrobot, you need to configure it to run in *'advanced'* mode:
- joints position value is in *radian*
- motors main controller loop and joints state publisher runs in 30hz.
- required interfaces and controller such as `robot_state_publisher` and `JointTrajectoryController` are available

**Update ros-kinetic-qt-motor package if necessary:**

First check and update (if necessary) the `ros-kinetic-qt-motor` package on the QTrobot head machine (QTRP). ssh to the QTRP (e.g. via QTPC or your desktop) and
```
qtrobot@QTXXX: apt list ros-kinetic-qt-motor
ros-kinetic-qt-motor/now 1.2.0-0xenial armhf [installed,local]
```
if the version of `ros-kinetic-qt-motor` is older then `1.2.0`, you NEED to update it:

make a copy of your current QTrobot configuration (`qtrobot-hardware.yaml`). You need this file to put it back after updating the package:
```
qtrobot@QTXXX: cp /opt/ros/kinetic/share/qt_motor/config/qtrobot-hardware.yaml ~/
```
install the latest version of `ros-kinetic-qt-motor`. in my case it is `1.2.0-0`:
```
qtrobot@QTXXX: cd ~/robot/packages/dep
qtrobot@QTXXX: git pull
qtrobot@QTXXX: sudo apt remove ros-kinetic-qt-motor
qtrobot@QTXXX: sudo dpkg -i ros-kinetic-qt-motor_1.2.0-0xenial_armhf.deb
```
put back your QTrobot configuration (`qtrobot-hardware.yaml`):
```
qtrobot@QTXXX: sudo cp ~/qtrobot-hardware.yaml /opt/ros/kinetic/share/qt_motor/config/
```

**Change motor launcher autostart script to run in advanced mode:**
```
qtrobot@QTXXX: nano ~/robot/autostart/start_qt_motor.sh
```
and change the corresponding line to look like the following and save and exit:
```
roslaunch qt_motor qt_motor_advanced.launch
```

Reboot the robot to run the advance motor interface.


**Check the advanced mode setup:**
After rebooting the reboot, you can check (from QTPC, QTRP or your machine) if the motor interface is running in the advanced mode:

joint state publisher frequency:
```
qtrobot@QTXXX: rostopic hz /qt_robot/joints/state
average rate: 30.041
	min: 0.029s max: 0.047s std dev: 0.00391s window: 29
```

joints value should be in radian:
```
qtrobot@QTXXX: rostopic echo /qt_robot/joints/state
position: [0.015707962851830046, 0.0, -0.6073745663782212, 1.569051024174513, -0.9896016991965904, -0.5689773095185405, -0.3455751785790718, -0.8360127383368947]
```

trajectory controller is running:
```
qtrobot@QTXXX: rostopic type  /qt_robot/left_arm_controller/follow_joint_trajectory/goal
control_msgs/FollowJointTrajectoryActionGoal
```

### Your machine setup (e.g. QTPC)
After checking and updating the QTrobot setup, you can install the iKfast solver plugin for MoveIt on the machine which you plan to run the example:

clone the QTrobot open software repository:
```
cd ~/
git clone https://github.com/luxai-qtrobot/software.git
```
build the plugins:
```
cd ~/catkin_ws
ln -s ~/software/qtrobot_ikfast_right_arm_plugin/ ./
ln -s ~/software/qtrobot_ikfast_right_left_plugin/ ./
cd ../
catkin_make
```


## clone and build the motors_moveit
Assuming that you have cloned the `tutorial` repository somewhere on your home folder (e.g. `~/tutorials`):

```
cd ~/catkin_ws
ln -s ~/tutorials/examples/motors_moveit ./
cd ../
catkin_make
```
or copy the `motors_moveit` to your catkin_ws.  

## How to run the examples
Launch `moveit_qtrobot.launch` to start move_group planner and rviz:

```
roslaunch motors_moveit moveit_qtrobot.launch
```

wait until rviz shows up, then run one of the following demos:

### Drawing rectangle
```
rosrun motors_moveit draw_rectangle.py joint_states:=/qt_robot/joints/state
```

### Drawing spiral
```
rosrun motors_moveit draw_spiral.py joint_states:=/qt_robot/joints/state
```
